# whoAMI-scanner 
The `whoAMI-scanner` is a command-line tool that scans your AWS account(s) for instances created from untrusted Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). It was developed alongside our blog post [whoAMI: A cloud image name confusion attack](), which shares a new way attackers can potentially trick victims into using malicious AMIs. 

The most effective protection against the whoAMI attack is to leverage AWS's [Allowed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-allowed-amis.html) feature (released December 1, 2024). However, we created `whoAMI-scanner` to give you a quick way to identity any instancess sourced from **Unverified Community AMIs**.   

# Quick Start
```
❯ whoAMI-scanner --profile profile_name 
```

# Details
The `whoAMI-scanner` tool provides several options to customize its behavior:  
```
    --profile: Specify the AWS profile to use. [Default: uses AWS CLI defaults (Checks default profile, then environment variables, then IMDS)]
    --region: Specify one specific AWS region to scan. [Default: all regions]
    --trusted-accounts: Specify a list of trusted AWS accounts to compare against. [Default: No trusted accounts]
    --output: Specify the output file for the CSV results. [Default: No output file]

# FAQ
#### Q: What is the purpose of this tool?  
A: The `whoAMI-scanner` helps you detect the use of untrusted AMIs in your AWS environment.  

#### Q: How do I specify multiple regions?  
A: Currently you can only specify one region at a time or run the tool against all regions (default).  

#### Q: What is meant by trusted accounts?
A: For companies using AWS organizations, a common practice is to have one account that shares trusted AMIs 
   with other accounts in the organization without making the AMIs public. The --trusted-accounts option in 
   whoAMI-scanner allows you to specify those accounts so they are not considered untrusted by the tool.

#### Q: What is meant by allowed accounts?
A: AWS's "Allowed AMIs" is a guardrail that AWS introduced to clearly define the accounts you are allowed to use 
   AMIs from. The whoAMI-scanner tool checks to see if this guardrail is enabled in your account and if it is, it
   uses that information to determine if the AMIs in use are from allowed accounts.

#### Q: What's the difference between trusted accounts and allowed accounts?
A: "Allowed accounts" refers to the offical AWS control, "Allowed AMIs". This tool makes calls to the AWS APIs 
   to get this info and process it within the tool. Trusted accounts are provided as user input to this tool and
   are used to help you get better results. You should only need to use one or the other. If you are using AWS's 
   allowed AMIs you can just lean on that. If you have not enabled allowed AMIs yet, you can use --trusted-accounts 
   within this tool.    

#### Q: How can I contribute to this project?  
A: Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
