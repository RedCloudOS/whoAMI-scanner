# whoAMI-scanner 
The `whoAMI-scanner` is a command-line tool that scans your AWS account(s) for instances running on untrusted Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). It was developed alongside our blog post [whoAMI: A cloud image name confusion attack](), which reveals how attackers can potentially trick victims into using malicious AMIs. 

The most effective protection against the whoAMI attack is to leverage AWS's [Allowed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-allowed-amis.html) feature (released December 1, 2024). However, we created `whoAMI-scanner` to give you a quick way to identity any instancess sourced from **Unverified Community AMIs**.   

# Quick Start
```
❯ whoAMI-scanner --profile cfdeploy 
```

# Details
The whoAMI-scanner tool provides several options to customize its behavior:  
```
    --profile: Specify the AWS profile to use. [Default: uses AWS CLI defaults (Checks default profile, then environment variables, then IMDS)]
    --region: Specify one specific AWS region to scan. [Default: all regions]
    --trusted-accounts: Specify a list of trusted AWS accounts to compare against. [Default: No trusted accounts]
    --output: Specify the output file for the CSV results. [Default: No output file]

# FAQ
Q: What is the purpose of this tool?  
A: The whoAMI-scanner helps you detect the use of untrusted AMIs in your AWS environment.  

Q: How do I specify multiple regions?  
A: Currently you can only specify one region at a time or run the tool against all regions (default).  

Q: What is meant by trusted accounts?
A: For companies using AWS organizations, a common practice is to have one account that shares trusted AMIs 
   with other accounts in the organization without making the AMIs public. The --trusted-accounts option in 
   whoAMI-scanner allows you to specify those accounts.

Q: What is mean by allowed accounts?
A: AWS's "Allowed AMIs" is a guardrail that AWS introduced to clearly define the accounts you are allowed to use 
   AMIs from. The whoAMI-scanner tool checks to see if this guardrail is enabled in your account and if it is, it
   uses that information to determine if the AMIs in use are from allowed accounts.

Q: How can I contribute to this project?  
A: Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
